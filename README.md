# SFND 2D Feature Tracking

<img src="images/keypoints.png" width="820" height="248" />

This is a midterm project in the second section - "Camera" of Udacity's Sensor Fusion nanodegree. The overall goal of the "Camera" course is to build a collision detection system. As preparation for this, a feature tracking between two consecutive 2D camera images from the "KITTI" dataset is done. Various detector / descriptor combinations are tested to see which one is able to detect and match more keypoints in the least time. 


This mid-term project consists of four parts:

* First, create a ring buffer of a specific size to only keep a specified amount of images at a time and optimize memory load. 
* Then, integrate several keypoint detectors such as SHI-TOMASI, HARRIS, FAST, BRISK and SIFT and compare them with regard to number of keypoints and speed. 
* In the next part, several descriptor extraction and matching using brute force and also the FLANN Nearest neighbour (KNN) approach. 
* In the last part, test the various algorithms using all permutations and combinations of detector - descriptor in different combinations and compare performance measures. 


## Performance analysis - Data Description

### Generate descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and  shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, excluding NaN values.

    Total time (ms)             388.096
    Name: 122, dtype: object



##  Analysis:

As can be seen from the above, the best detector - descriptor for keypoint calculation and matching is FAST detector and BRIEF descriptor based on both the most num of keypoints detector as well as least time for descriptor matching.
